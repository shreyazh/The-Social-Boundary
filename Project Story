## Inspiration  
Understanding how social boundaries evolve across humans, animals, and AI interactions inspired this research. By integrating psychology, sociology, and ethology, we aim to model the fluid nature of sociability.  

## What it does  
The Social Boundary framework quantifies and explains the dynamic limits of interaction comfort, adapting based on familiarity, context, and frequency. It applies to human relationships, AI-human interactions, and interspecies communication.  

## How we built it  
We synthesized theories like Social Penetration Theory, Dunbarâ€™s Number, and Politeness Theory, constructing a mathematical model to represent boundary evolution. Observational studies, case analyses, and AI behavior modeling inform our approach.  

## Challenges we ran into  
- Capturing the variability of social boundaries across different species and cultural contexts.  
- Developing a mathematical model that accounts for immediate and gradual shifts in familiarity.  
- Ensuring AI-driven interactions adapt ethically without overstepping user comfort.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Proposing a unified model applicable to human, AI, and interspecies sociability.  
- Highlighting the impact of first-time interactions in rapidly shifting social boundaries.  
- Outlining applications for AI-human engagement, urban social integration, and cross-cultural studies.  

## What we learned  
- Social boundaries are more fluid than previously understood, sometimes shrinking rapidly.  
- AI and robotics can benefit from adaptive sociability models to improve human interaction.  
- Context plays a crucial role in determining the pace of boundary adjustments.  

## What's next for The Social Boundary  
- Empirical validation through surveys, AI-human interaction tests, and animal studies.  
- Exploring neuroscience to understand brain activity linked to boundary shifts.  
- Expanding applications in digital communication, diplomacy, and conservation efforts.
